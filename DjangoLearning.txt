Django 
----------

1. What are projects? What are apps?

In Django, there is only ONE project. There can be many "apps" within it, but there is 
ever only one project. 

What do you think our project is this application?

Apps on the other hand, are small libraries representing a discrete
part of a larger project. For example, if we were to create a blog project, we might have an app
to handle blog posts, and one to handle static pages, like an About page called pages, and another app 
called payments to charge logged-in subsribers. 

What do you think would be some good apps in Django?

2. What are models? 

We all know what an object is right? We know what a database is right?

A model is a special type of object that can be stored in a database.
Here's an example 

User
---------------
name
password
to_string() -> String

Employee(User)
---------------
department 
role
images[File of PNGs/ JPGs]
is_current_employee() -> bool 
get_bitmap()

Connector
------------------
name
api_key
establish_connection()
stop_connection()


3. What are URLs?

Each app has URLs that a user would be able to access via web browser.

 As maintainers of the application, what sort of web pages would be a good idea?
